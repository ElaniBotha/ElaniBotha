### Hi there 👋 My name is Elani

I am a Software Dev in training. 🤸‍♂️🏋️‍♀️🤸‍♂️🚴‍♀️🏋️‍♀️

I am transitioning my career from healthcare as a pharmacist to the dynamic world of IT. My plan is to become a fullstack developer and then later transform the healthcare environment with tech.

I don't know much yet, but watch this space...
